# Data Scientist Exercise

## Description
I was tasked with estimating UK 2019 General Election results for England and Wales using a simple Multilevel Regression and Poststratification (MRP) model.

### Data
For my poststratification I used population counts for interlocked demographic groups, downloaded from the ONS's "Create  a custom dataset" page. The demographic characteristics included were age, highest level of qualification and sex.
To develop a set of models to estimate differential turnout rates and the percentage of people voting for the Conservatives, Labor, Liberal Democrats, or Other parties, I used cross-sectional data from the 2019 BES Post-Election Random Probability Survey.
